A smaller version of Anax with limited features, the bare essentials to put together a response of a request.

Compare with a micro framework or a smaller service providing a API or smaller website.

If you want to create a lot of content, such as web pages, then you should look at [Anax Flat](https://github.com/canax/anax-flat2) instead.



Install
------------------

You can install and scaffold a complete site using [anax-cli](https://github.com/canax/anax-cli). This is how to scaffold a site in the directory "site".

```
anax create site anax-lite-site
```

Point your web browser to the directory "site/htdocs".

There are some plain development routes mounted on the route "dev/".
